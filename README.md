# NALMDB - Movie Rating App

---

### After cloning the project on your local machine, `cd` into the project folder and run the following to install the dependencies:
```
cd client
npm install
```

---

### Then run the server on `http://localhost:3000` with the following command:
```
npm start
```

---

### Progress Update
* Backend has not been implemented yet (other than some boilerplate code) due to time constraints. App is functional without it as account creation, authentication and user data storage (numerical ratings, watchlists and favorite lists, etc) are handled by the TMDB API. Written reviews do not persist as of yet, however.

### To-do-list:
1. Improve mobile responsiveness
2. Add backend
